# Context

Client: My friend, Michael burns who is a local Calgary photographer

Goal: to create a page for Mike to display his work, and so potential clients can message him for a shoot, and or pricing for picture prints.

## Assignment 4 - Hero Page

For the most part, the page is responsive, except the hamburger menu. It shows on mobile view, but when it's clicked, the text from the home page is still visible because z-index for burger-menu is not 1. However when I use z-index: 1, it messes with the responsiveness of the entire page on mobile and you can't click anything except the burger menu. I will come back to this at a later time to find a way to fix it! For the assignment, it doesn't have to be operable so I will leave it for now.
